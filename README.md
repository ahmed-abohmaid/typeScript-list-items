# TypeScript List Items

## Introduction

### This is my first project to practice TypeSctipt.

The TypeScript List Items project is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage a to-do list. Users can add new items to the list, mark items as completed with checkboxes, and remove items from the list. The project is built using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Usage
Live: https://ahmed-abohmaid.github.io/typeScript-list-items

## Technologies Used
- TypeScript with Vite
- HTML
- CSS

## Features

- The main page displays an input field to add new to-do items, a "Clear" button to remove all items from the list, and an empty list.
  
- To add a new item, type the item name in the input field and press the "Add" button (+). The new item will be added to the list.
  
- Each item in the list is represented by a checkbox, the item's name, and a "Remove" button (X).
  
- Users can mark an item as completed by checking its corresponding checkbox. This will save the item's state in local storage.
  
- To remove an item from the list, click the "Remove" button (X) next to the item. The item will be removed from the list and from local storage.
  
- Clicking the "Clear" button will remove all items from the list and clear local storage.
